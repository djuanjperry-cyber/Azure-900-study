    <CodeInstructions>
        <rule>Provide Lightweight, Performant, Clean architectural code.</rule>
        <rule>You should always work with clearly separated, minimal and targeted solutions that prioritize clean architecture over feature complexity.</rule>
        <rule>Focus on synchronous, deterministic operations for production stability rather than introducing async frameworks that add unnecessary complexity and potential failure points.</rule>
        
        <Python>
            <PackageManagement>
                <rule>Use uv as the package manager and runner for Python projects.</rule>
                <rule>## Project Initialization
                    When initializing a new Python project with uv:
                    - If the user is already in a project directory (indicated by workspace path), use `uv init` or `uv init .` to initialize in the current directory
                    - Do NOT use `uv init <project-name>` as this creates a subdirectory
                    - Only use `uv init <project-name>` if explicitly creating a new project in a parent directory
                </rule>
                <rule>Add packages with: uv add &lt;package&gt; or uv add 'package==version'</rule>
                <rule>Remove packages with: uv remove &lt;package&gt;</rule>
                <rule>Upgrade packages with: uv lock --upgrade-package &lt;package&gt;</rule>
                <rule>Run script modules with: uv run &lt;module&gt;.py (not uv run python &lt;module&gt;.py)</rule>
                <rule>Build projects with: uv build</rule>
            </PackageManagement>
            
            <FastAPI>
                <rule>Prefer async endpoints unless blocked by sync-only code (‚ö†Ô∏è conflicts with general sync preference - evaluate per project needs).</rule>
                <rule>Use dependency injection for shared services.</rule>
                <rule>Start dev server with: uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload</rule>
                <rule>Version endpoints (e.g., /api/v1/...)</rule>
                <rule>Expose OpenAPI docs</rule>

            <DatabaseAndORM>
                <rule>Use SQLAlchemy or async ORM (e.g., Tortoise)</rule>
                <rule>Use Alembic for migrations</rule>
                <rule>Avoid raw SQL</rule>

            <Python GUIs>
            <rule> If you build a local GUI for an app, never use tkinter or tcl.  Always use a modern gui framework like PySide
            </Python GUIs>
        </Python>
        <rule>Maintain strict separation of concerns across modules, ensuring each component has a single, well-defined responsibility.</rule>
        <rule>Work with modular project layout and centralized main module, SoC is critical for project flexibility.</rule>
        <rule>Analyze when separation of concerns would harm the architecture. Question: Do these pieces of code change for the same reason, at the same time? If yes, they should probably live together. If no, separation might be valuable.</rule>
        <rule>Question: Does the separation make the system easier to reason about, test, or evolve? If no, it‚Äôs accidental complexity, not helpful SoC.</rule>
        <rule>Each project should include a benchmarking suite that links directly to projects modules for real testing during development to catch improvements/regressions in real-time.</rule>
        <rule>Benchmarking suite must include generalized output to .json with collected data (component: result).</rule>
        <rule>Apply optimizations only to proven bottlenecks with measurable impact, avoiding premature optimization that clutters the codebase (eg.: Regressions after a change).</rule>

        <rule>Preserve code readability and maintainability as primary concerns, ensuring that any performance improvements don't sacrifice code clarity.</rule>
        <rule>Resist feature bloat and complexity creep by consistently asking whether each addition truly serves the core purpose.</rule>
        <rule>Multiple languages don't violate the principles when each serves a specific, measurable purpose. The complexity is then justified by concrete performance gains and leveraging each language's strengths.</rule>
        <rule>Prioritize deterministic behavior and long-runtime stability over cutting-edge patterns that may introduce unpredictability.</rule>
        <rule>When sharing code, you should always contain the code to its own artifact with clear path labeling.</rule>
