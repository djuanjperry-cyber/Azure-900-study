this is we have something to help us do this is we have something to help us do this is we have something called life cycle management now this is a free management now this is a free management now this is a free solution and it's really just focused on solution and it's really just focused on solution and it's really just focused on moving data between tiers and deleting moving data between tiers and deleting moving data between tiers and deleting data so it's really about optimizing our data so it's really about optimizing our data so it's really about optimizing our costs so I could

could do World cards I could do so I could do World cards I could do so I could do World cards I could do question mark for single question mark for single question mark for single characters um and again it I create characters um and again it I create characters um and again it I create these centralized policies and actions I these centralized policies and actions I these centralized policies and actions I then apply to different storage accounts then apply to different storage accounts then apply to different storage accounts so it has way more so it has way more so it has way more scale

firewall direct things to go to the firewall using user defined routes using user defined routes using user defined routes so now the traffic is going to this so now the traffic is going to this so now the traffic is going to this azure firewall and what we can do is a azure firewall and what we can do is a azure firewall and what we can do is a number of different things number of different things number of different things because it understands layer 7 because it understands layer 7 because it understands layer 7 we have things like application rules we have things like application rules we have things like application rules so an application rule can understand so an application rule can understand so an application rule can understand it can understand a fully qualified it can understand a fully qualified it can understand a fully qualified domain name it can understand categories domain name it can understand categories domain name it can understand categories and i can allow or block those things and i can allow or block those things and i can allow or block those things it's also layer four so i can still have it's also layer four so i can still have it's also layer four so i can still have network rules network rules network rules the idea of an nsg i'm basing it around the idea of an nsg i'm basing it around the idea of an nsg i'm basing it around ip addresses and ports and things like ip addresses and ports and things like ip addresses and ports and things like so i can do both of those levels now so i can do both of those levels now so i can do both of those levels now there are different versions of azure there are different versions of azure there are different versions of azure firewall there is a premium skew firewall there is a premium skew firewall there is a premium skew and one of the great things the premium and one of the great things the premium and one of the great things the premium sku does is often our traffic is sku does is often our traffic is sku does is often our traffic is encrypted it's tls encrypted which means encrypted it's tls encrypted which means encrypted it's tls encrypted which means we can't read it we can't even see the we can't read it we can't even see the we can't read it we can't even see the path because when i have tls encryption path because when i have tls encryption path because when i have tls encryption it's between the basic ip addresses you it's between the basic ip addresses you it's between the basic ip addresses you can't even see the path of what's being can't even see the path of what's being can't even see the path of what's being sent or requested sent or requested sent or requested so one of the things azure firewall can so one of the things azure firewall can so one of the things azure firewall can do is with the premium sku it can actually do tls inspection it can actually do tls inspection it can actually do tls inspection it sits in between it sits in between it sits in between and it replaces certificate so it can and it replaces certificate so it can and it replaces certificate so it can now read that encrypted traffic it can now read that encrypted traffic it can now read that encrypted traffic it can see the urls it could then work out the see the urls it could then work out the see the urls it could then work out the categories to give me protection even if categories to give me protection even if categories to give me protection even if that traffic is encrypted that traffic is encrypted that traffic is encrypted now the other thing it can do it has dna now the other thing it can do it has dna now the other thing it can do it has dna type rules so i could think about well type rules so i could think about well type rules so i could think about well there's public ip addresses there's public ip addresses there's public ip addresses that belong to azure firewall so as that belong to azure firewall so as that belong to azure firewall so as requests come in it can actually do requests come in it can actually do requests come in it can actually do denating so dnatting is where it can say denating so dnatting is where it can say denating so dnatting is where it can say you're coming into this particular port you're coming into this particular port you're coming into this particular port i'm going to send you to a particular i'm going to send you to a particular i'm going to send you to a particular virtual machine maybe that's useful for virtual machine maybe that's useful for virtual machine maybe that's useful for rdp or ssh or other things i want to be rdp or ssh or other things i want to be rdp or ssh or other things i want to be able to get to a particular machine but able to get to a particular machine but able to get to a particular machine but it can still apply these rules to it can still apply these rules to it can still apply these rules to control who can actually go and access control who can actually go and access control who can actually go and access i mean there's a whole set of different i mean there's a whole set of different i mean there's a whole set of different functionalities around azure firewall functionalities around azure firewall functionalities around azure firewall but the point is this is an actual edge but the point is this is an actual edge but the point is this is an actual edge device it's an actual set of virtual device it's an actual set of virtual device it's an actual set of virtual machines that uses vm scale sets behind machines that uses vm scale sets behind machines that uses vm scale sets behind the scenes but it's fully managed the scenes but it's fully managed the scenes but it's fully managed i am not doing anything around this i am not doing anything around this i am not doing anything around this it does auto scale it does auto scale it does auto scale based on the actual demands of the based on the actual demands of the based on the actual demands of the amount of traffic that's coming in and i amount of traffic that's coming in and i amount of traffic that's coming in and i would pay accordingly would pay accordingly would pay accordingly but now it is actually some device that but now it is actually some device that but now it is actually some device that sits at the edge and can send the sits at the edge and can send the sits at the edge and can send the traffic out and let it come in traffic out and let it come in traffic out and let it come in for my network and i would use this with for my network and i would use this with for my network and i would use this with nsgs i would still use network security nsgs i would still use network security nsgs i would still use network security to maybe do other types of internal to maybe do other types of internal to maybe do other types of internal protection because i think remember that protection because i think remember that protection because i think remember that defense in depth this is very much a defense in depth this is very much a defense in depth this is very much a perimeter type solution but i still want perimeter type solution but i still want perimeter type solution but i still want that least kind of privileged least that least kind of privileged least that least kind of privileged least as much as i can so it's not do i use as much as i can so it's not do i use as much as i can so it's not do i use this or nsgs i'd like to use them this or nsgs i'd like to use them this or nsgs i'd like to use them together to really maximize my layers of together to really maximize my layers of together to really maximize my layers of",
